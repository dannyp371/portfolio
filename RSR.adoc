== ReadySet Rallly demo

This guide will instruct you on setting up a self-hosted
link:github.com/lukevella/rallly-selfhosted[Rallly] site with ReadySet
enabled for faster database queries.

=== Prerequisites

* ReadySet local build: See instuctions
link:github.com/readysettech/readyset#development[here]
* Self-hosted link:github.com/lukevella/rallly-selfhosted[Rallly] site

=== Procedure

[arabic]
. Connect your database to your Rallly application by editing your
`config.env` file. Uncomment `DATABASE_URL` and set its value to the
connection string of ReadySet

[source,shellsession]
----
DATABASE_URL=<your ReadySet connection string>
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Connect to your database psql in this case

[source,shellsession]
----
$ psql -h <hostname> -p <port> -d <database type> -U <username>
----

[arabic, start=3]
. From here, run the ReadySet custom `SHOW READYSET TABLES` command.
This will confirm that your database did connect to ReadySet, and
display the status of your database tables. Do no proceed until until
all table statusâ€™ are `Snapshotted`

!!! note This process can take some time depending on how many tables
are in your database

[source,sql]
----
dbname=>SHOW READYSET TABLES;
----

[source,text,nocopy]
----
   table    |    status
------------+-------------
table1      |  Snapshotted
table2      |  Snapshotted
(2 rows)
----

[arabic, start=4]
. While still in your database, run any queries you would normally want
to run for this data

[source,sql]
----
dbname=>SELECT * FROM table1;
----

[arabic, start=5]
. Since these queries are not cached, they were proxied to your upstream
database. You can pull a list of any proxied queries by running the
following ReadySet command

[source,sql]
----
dbname=>SHOW PROXIED QUERIES;
----

This will output each of your queries, their query id, and if they are
ReadySet supported.

[arabic, start=6]
. Any of your proxied queries you wish to have avaible quickly on demand
should be cached using the `CREATE CACHE FROM` command

[source,sql]
----
dbname=>CREATE CACHE FROM <query1>;
----

!!! Note In the above example can be the query itself, or the query id
in the proxied queries list shown in step 5

[arabic, start=7]
. Verify that your caches were created by running the `SHOW CACHES`
command

[source,sql]
----
dbname=>SHOW CACHES;
----
